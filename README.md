# Conway's Game of Life

This code is a project I was working on in CSCI 250 - Concepts of Computer Systems. It is a rendition of Conway's game of life written in MIPS32 assembly. The code was originally written to be executed in a MIPS Assembly simulator like SPIM or MARS, but in this repo I am adapting it to be emulated in qemu-mips running on Ubuntu in WSL.
